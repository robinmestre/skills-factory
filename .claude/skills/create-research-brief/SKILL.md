## 7. Multi-Hypothesis Framing

### When to Enable
- Testing predictions or forecasts
- Evaluating competing theories
- Decision involves binary or multi-way choice
- Need to avoid confirmation bias

### Process
1. Define core question as testable prediction
2. Generate 2-4 MECE hypotheses covering all outcomes
3. Assign prior probabilities (must sum to 100%)
4. Define supporting and refuting evidence for each
5. Research gathers evidence against criteria
6. Update posteriors based on evidence strength

### Example
```xml
<hypotheses question="Will enterprise adopt GenAI for customer service by 2027?">
  <hypothesis id="H1" position="broad" prior="30%">
    >50% enterprise adoption
  </hypothesis>
  <hypothesis id="H2" position="selective" prior="50%">
    10-50% adoption in specific use cases
  </hypothesis>
  <hypothesis id="H3" position="limited" prior="20%">
    <10% adoption due to barriers
  </hypothesis>
</hypotheses>
```

## 8. Evidence Strength Tribunal

5-point scale for evaluating source quality:

| Score | Name | Definition | Examples |
|-------|------|------------|----------|
| **5** | Primary | Direct from entity being researched | SEC filings, earnings calls, official docs |
| **4** | Auth. Secondary | Major analysts with citations | Gartner, Forrester, WSJ investigative |
| **3** | Credible Secondary | Reputable sources, some sourcing | TechCrunch, industry publications |
| **2** | Weak Secondary | Unsourced, outdated, anonymous | LinkedIn self-reports, old reports |
| **1** | Speculative | No verifiable basis | Rumors, predictions, fabrications |

**Time Decay:** Apply -1 for technology data >6 months, market data >1 year.

**Reference:** See `references/evidence-strength-rubric.md` for full scoring guidelines.

---

## 9. Conflict Resolution: WWHTBT

When models or sources disagree and resolution isn't clear, apply **What Would Have To Be True** analysis:

```xml
<conflict claim="Market size for X">
  <position holder="Gartner" value="$50B">
    <evidence score="4">2024 market report with methodology</evidence>
  </position>
  <position holder="IDC" value="$35B">
    <evidence score="4">Different scope definition</evidence>
  </position>

  <wwhtbt>
    <for_gartner>
      <condition>Adjacent markets included in scope</condition>
      <condition>Projected vs. realized revenue counted</condition>
    </for_gartner>
    <for_idc>
      <condition>Only core product category</condition>
      <condition>Realized revenue only</condition>
    </for_idc>
  </wwhtbt>

  <recommendation>
    Report range ($35-50B) with scope dependency noted.
    For our purposes, IDC definition more aligned.
  </recommendation>
</conflict>
```

---

## 10. Uncertainty Decomposition

| Type | Definition | Can Reduce? | Action |
|------|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Epistemic** | Knowledge gaps that COULD be closed | YES | Research further |
| **Aleatory** | Inherent randomness that CANNOT be predicted | NO | Quantify range, build scenarios |
| **Model** | Framework/definition dependencies | DEPENDS | Make choices explicit |

### Classification Questions
- **Epistemic:** "Does someone, somewhere know this?"
- **Aleatory:** "Even with perfect info, would this still be uncertain?"
- **Model:** "Would a different definition change the answer?"

**Reference:** See `references/uncertainty-taxonomy.md` for full classification protocol.

---

## 11. Gap Analysis

### Part 1: MECE Coverage Audit
Compare findings against expected coverage matrix for research type. Flag:
- **Critical gaps:** Core dimensions missing or Score ≤2
- **Significant gaps:** Supporting dimensions weak
- **Minor gaps:** Context items missing

### Part 2: Unknown Unknowns Probes

| Probe | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Adjacent Domain** | What lessons from related industries apply? |
| **Stakeholder Blind Spot** | Whose voice is missing from sources? |
| **Time Horizon** | What historical precedents or future implications are ignored? |
| **Failure Mode** | What would have to be true for conclusions to be wrong? |
| **Second-Order Effects** | If findings are true, what else must follow? |

**Reference:** See `references/gap-analysis-protocol.md` for full audit process.

2. Select domain-appropriate experts
3. Define deliberation format (round-robin, debate, Delphi)
4. Assign challenger role for assumption testing
5. Synthesize panel perspectives into findings

### Expert Selection by Domain
