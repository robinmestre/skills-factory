# Cognitive Process Architect

Generate domain-specific skills and workflows using advanced reasoning techniques.

## Purpose

This meta-skill orchestrates skill generation by:
1. Analyzing task requirements
2. Selecting appropriate patterns from the library
3. Instantiating templates with domain parameters
4. Generating executable SKILL.md files or portable prompts

## Core Libraries

This skill has access to (load on demand):
- `@core/technique-taxonomy.yaml` — 200+ techniques across 6 cognitive categories
- `@core/artifact-contracts.yaml` — Standardized I/O schemas
- `@core/scoring-rubrics.yaml` — Pluggable evaluation algorithms
- `@core/skill-patterns.yaml` — Parameterized workflow patterns

## Available Templates

| Template | Use Case | Key Parameters |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| `expert-panel` | Multi-perspective evaluation | domain, panel_size, goal |
| `tournament-ranking` | Pairwise comparison | items, criteria, algorithm |
| `adversarial-validation` | Red/blue team analysis | proposition, attack_vectors |
| `research-brief` | Multi-LLM research design | domain, models, depth |
| `gap-audit` | Completeness assessment | document, standards |
| `jtbd-extraction` | Job story generation | features, persona |
| `user-flow-mapping` | Journey documentation | process, touchpoints |
| `feature-extraction` | Identify features | context, granularity |
| `diataxis-documentation` | Generate docs | doc_type, audience |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis

When asked to create a skill or workflow:

1. **Identify the core task type:**
   - Evaluation/Comparison → Use MOE-EVALUATE or TOURNAMENT patterns
   - Generation/Ideation → Use MOE-GENERATE pattern
   - Validation/Testing → Use ADVERSARIAL-VALIDATE pattern
   - Research/Discovery → Use RESEARCH-SYNTHESIZE pattern
   - Documentation → Use DIATAXIS pattern
   - Extraction → Use ELICIT-EXTRACT pattern

2. **Determine parameters needed:**
   - Domain/context
   - Stakeholders
   - Quality dimensions
   - Output format

3. **Check for existing skills that might compose:**
   - Can we chain existing skills?
   - What's missing that requires new skill?

### Phase 2: Pattern Selection

Load `@core/skill-patterns.yaml` and select pattern based on:

| Task Type | Pattern | When to Use |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Compare options | MOE-EVALUATE | 2-8 options, need expert perspectives |
| Rank many items | TOURNAMENT-RANK | >5 items, need statistical ranking |
| Generate ideas | MOE-GENERATE | Need diverse, expert-informed ideas |
| Stress-test decision | ADVERSARIAL-VALIDATE | High-stakes, need to find weaknesses |
| Synthesize research | RESEARCH-SYNTHESIZE | Multiple sources to reconcile |
| Check completeness | GAP-AUDIT | Document against standards |
| Extract requirements | ELICIT-EXTRACT | Unstructured → structured |

### Phase 3: Template Instantiation

Based on selected pattern, configure template:
```yaml
skill_instantiation:
  pattern: "[selected pattern]"
  domain: "[user's domain]"
  parameters:
    # Pattern-specific parameters
  techniques:
    # Selected from technique-taxonomy
  output_contract:
    # From artifact-contracts
```

### Phase 4: Output Generation

Generate one of:

**A. Executable Skill (SKILL.md)**
- Complete frontmatter with triggers
- Full workflow instructions
- Quality gates
- Output templates

**B. Portable Prompt**
- Standalone prompt for other contexts
- Self-contained instructions
- No skill dependencies

## Quality Gates

Before completing skill generation:

- [ ] Pattern selection rationale documented
- [ ] All required parameters configured
- [ ] Technique provenance traced (which techniques from taxonomy)
- [ ] Output contract specified (from artifact-contracts)
- [ ] Triggers are specific and actionable
- [ ] Description includes numbered use cases

## Examples

**Example 1: Create evaluation skill**
User: Create a skill for evaluating architecture proposals
Cognitive Process Architect:
→ Task type: Evaluation/Comparison
→ Pattern: MOE-EVALUATE
→ Domain: Architecture
→ Generate: architecture-evaluator skill with:

Technical Authority, Quality Guardian, Risk Specialist experts
Criteria: scalability, maintainability, cost, security
Output: RANKED-SOLUTION-LIST contract


**Example 2: Create research workflow**
User: Build a workflow for competitive analysis
Cognitive Process Architect:
→ Task type: Research/Discovery
→ Pattern: RESEARCH-SYNTHESIZE
→ Domain: Competitive intelligence
→ Generate: competitive-analyzer skill with:

Research brief generation (Claude + Gemini)
Consolidation workflow
Gap identification
